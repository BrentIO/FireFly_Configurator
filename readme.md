# FireFly Configurator

## About
FireFly Configurator assists with the configuration of the FireFly Controller(s) and Clients.  Utilizing the Configurator, you will be presented with a GUI tool where all configurations can be centrally managed, including settings, inputs, outputs, breakers, switch and button assignments, as well as visualization for the entire network.

## Server Requirements
Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 Server
HTTP Server: Apache 2.4.41
Database: MySQL 8.0.20
Language Processor: PHP 7.4.3

Hardware requirements are minimal (single core processor, 2GB RAM, 40GB hard drive is more than sufficient); This server handles few simultaneous requests, and they are very lightweight.

## FireFly Configurator Installation
To install, download and copy install.sh from GitHub.  This script will clone the necessary files and will automatically configure your installation.

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrentIO/FireFly_Configurator/master/install.sh`

Run the downloaded file with elevated permissions

MySQL will prompt for various input to secure the MySQL server.  Recommended settings:

> Would you like to setup VALIDATE PASSWORD component?
> Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No: `N`

> Please set the password for root here.
> **This is the new root password, not the firefly password.  Do not lose this password.**
> New password:

> Remove anonymous users? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : `Y`

> Disallow root login remotely? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : `Y`

> Remove test database and access to it? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : `Y`

> Reload privilege tables now? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : `Y`

### For development access only

> **Do not execute this section on a production server.  The following steps must be taken to enable MySQL Workbench access.  If you do not need access to MySQL Workbench for development purposes, do not execute this section.**

Login to MySQL with sudo:
`$ sudo mysql`

Change the root user to use a native password:
`mysql> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';`

Edit the configuration file to change the binding from `127.0.0.1` to `0.0.0.0`:
`$ sudo sed -i 's/127.0.0.1/0.0.0.0/' /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf`

Restart MySQL:

`$ sudo systemctl restart mysql`

Login to MySQL with the updated root account, and enter the password when prompted:
`$ mysql -u root -p`

Create the new remote account:
`mysql> CREATE USER 'remote'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';`

Grant the user super admin privileges:
`mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'remote'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;`

Flush the privileges table to pick up the changes:
`mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;`

You can now log into MySQL with username `remote`.
